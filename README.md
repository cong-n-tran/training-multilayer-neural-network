# Training a Multilayer Neural Network

This repository demonstrates how to train a multilayer neural network from scratch using only **NumPy**—no machine learning frameworks. The project is based on the **UCI dataset**.

## Features
- Implementation of a fully connected neural network from scratch.
- Training and evaluation on the UCI dataset.
- No external ML libraries—entirely built with **NumPy**.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- (Optional) Install additional libraries for data preprocessing, if needed.
